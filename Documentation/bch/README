This is a simple test framework for the BCH library.

It is supposed to reside in directory linux/Documentation/bch in order to allow
direct inline including of file lib/bch.c. Edit Makefile and tu_*.c files if
this is not the case.

Porting to a specific architecture should be quite easy; just at look at
Makefile and arch.mk.

The following shell scripts should be generated:

xxx_tu_short.sh  => short test suite (runs for typically less than 1 hour)
xxx_tu_medium.sh => longer test suite (several hours)
xxx_tu_long.sh   => very long test suite (several weeks)

Those scripts invoke a combination of the various compiled test tools. See the
headers of tu_*.c files for details.
